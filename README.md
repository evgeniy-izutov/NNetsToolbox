# NNetsToolbox

Toolbox include different types of neural nets:

  * MLP (Multilayer Perceptron which can be trained by the backpropagation algorithm)
  * Generative RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine used for unsupervised learning)
  * Classification RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine used for the classification task)

All training methods use next improvements:

  * Nesterov's gradient
  * local learning rates
  * global learning rate strategy
